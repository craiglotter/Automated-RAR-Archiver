Automated RAR Archiver
======================

Automated RAR Archiver adds a simple scheduling ability to the RAR archiving programe. By selecting the start time for the archive operation to commence as well as the folder to archive, Automated RAR Archiver will run in the background, sleeping until the timer reaches the specified point. Once the scheduled time is met, a simple shell execute is called to begin the RAR operation.
